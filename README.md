# lpc1769-snake
Snake game I made for my integrated systems labs. Made for LPC1769 board with the expansion board.

## The cooler stuff done in this project are
- Snake nodes in a linked list structure
- screen update time independent of snake length
- variable game speed, changed with a potentiometer
- displaying player's score with 7 segment display combined with LEDs
- playing buzzer sounds on gameover and on food eaten (disabled in the demo video)

## Demo
